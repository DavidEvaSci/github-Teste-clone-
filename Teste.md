Creation of Eve
The epitomization of Eva Scientific’s earthly foundation: Tissue Engineering


Genesis, 2:
So the Lord God caused the man to fall into a deep sleep; and while he was sleeping, he took one of the man’s ribs and then closed up the place with flesh. Then the Lord God made a woman from the rib he had taken out of the man, and he brought her to the man.
